# WAV Trigger Audio File Processor

This module was built to expediate my process of loading music onto my WAV Trigger configuration card.

## Usage
Simply drop your `.mp3` and `.m4a` audio files into the source folder and the script processes them into the correct file number scope in the target directory.
