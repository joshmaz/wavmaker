3. Set project rate to 44,100 Hz
   - Look at the bottom left of the window

4. Export as WAV
   - `File > Export > Export as WAV`
   - Format: WAV (Microsoft) signed 16-bit PCM
   - Ensure "Stereo" is selected

5. Rename file with proper numeric prefix
   - Example: `007_Cowbell.wav` for Trigger 7
